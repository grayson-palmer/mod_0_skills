Becoming a Turing Student

1. Research Turing
  1.1 What is Turing?
    1.1.1 Read information on Turing website
      1.1.1.1 Read FE and BE program descriptions
      1.1.1.2 Read outcome reports
    1.1.2 Find external information and reviews
      1.1.2.1 Read information and reviews on CourseReport.com
      1.1.2.2 Find graduates on LinkedIn and contact them regarding experience
  1.2 Is Turing right for me?
    1.2.1 Look up Turing's vision/mission
      If vision aligns with positive/supportive environment
        1.2.1.1 Positive point, continue on
      Else
        1.2.1.1 Re-assess if right for me
    1.2.2 Duration of the program
      If duration_time > 3 months
        1.2.2.1 Validates want of longer term program, continue
      Else
        1.2.2.1 Re-assess if right for me
    1.2.3 How does Turing operate?
      If Operations are transparent and student_focused > profit_focused
        1.2.3.1 Validates, continue with program
      Else
        1.2.3.1 Re-assess if right for me
